import { forwardRef } from 'react'

//In React, forwardRef is a utility function that passes down a ref through a component to one of its children. This is particularly useful when you need to access a DOM element or component instance directly in a parent component, but the desired child element is wrapped by a higher-order component or a component that doesnâ€™t expose the ref by default.

//forwardRef takes a functional component as its argument and returns a new component with a forwarded ref attribute. This allows you to directly access the underlying child DOM node or instance from a parent component using the ref.

  extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {}

const Button = forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>(
  ({ className, children, disabled, type = 'button', ...props }, ref) => {
    return (
      <button
        type={type}
        className={twMerge(
